ArrayArrayLinear›An array is an object of fixed length that stores variables of the same type indexed from 0 to n-1 where n is the declared length. It allows multiple values to be stored within a single variable with a single declaration.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-LinearŒA binary search tree follows some order to arrange the elements in which the value of the left node must be smaller than the parent node and the value of the right node must be greater than the parent node.GraphGraphs
Non-Linear·A graph consists of a finite set of vertices (nodes) and set of edges which connect a pair of nodes. Graphs are used to represent networks which may include city paths, telephone networks, circuit networks or social networks.
Hash TableHash
Non-LinearËA hash table implements an associative array abstract data type (structure that can map keys to values). A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of slots/buckets from which the desired value can be found.HeapTree
Non-Linear In programming the heap is an area of pre-reserved computer main storage (memory) that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount that won‚Äôt be known until the program is running.Linked listListLinearºA linked list is a data structure which stores elements in the non-contiguous location meaning that acquired memory space is taken from different locations thus reducing wastage of memory.ListListLinear√A list is used to store a collection of similarly typed objects that may be accessed by index. The length of a list is flexible and can be resized as necessary for the number of elements present.QueueAbstractLinear–A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-Linear∆A self-balancing tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.SetAbstract
Non-LinearáA set is an unordered collection of distinct elements generally of the same type however may be made up of elements of different types.StackAbstractLinearÎA stack is an array or list structure of function calls and parameters used in computer programming and CPU architecture. Elements in a stack are added or removed from the top of the stack in a ‚Äúlast in‚Äù, ‚Äúfirst out‚Äù procedure.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearæA two-dimensional array shares the same properties as a one-dimensional array however differs in its declaration and is used to store array within an array thus making it an array of arrays.
